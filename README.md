## <p style="text-align: center;">**HTML Changes**</p>

* Changed all div tags to header, main, aside and footer tags because they are more descriptive than div tags alone. This helps to specifically represent different sections on the HTML page rather than classify them as divisions.  

* Changed the three div tags inside the main and aside tags to section tags. This helps to convey that the content within the section tags are distinctive sections opposed to the div tags which don't convey any meaning inside the tags.

* Added alt attributes to all images to provide a description of the images for those with impairments or who can't load the images in their browser.  

* Added missing id attribut to the first section so the nav bar would work properly. Before, nothing happpened when the nav bar was clicked.  

* Changed the h2 footer to h4. There was already an h2 and h3. 

## <p style="text-align: center;">**CSS Changes**</p>

* Changed the class header div to header nav to follow the HTML tags. 

* Changed the classes header div ul and header div ul li to header nav respectively. 

* Restructured and cleaned up redundant CSS in multiple areas because code was repetitive and was styled the same.

* Cleaned up code by condensing all repeated code under its corresponding selectors.
